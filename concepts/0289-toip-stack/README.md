## Summary

This Aries concept RFC introduces a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that integrates cryptographic trust at the machine layer with human trust at the business, legal, and social layers.

## Motivation

The importance of interoperability for the widespread adoption of an information network architecture has been proven by the dramatic rise to dominance of the Internet [1]. A key driver of the Internet's rise to dominance was the open source implementation of the TCP/IP stack in Version 4.2 of Berkeley Software Distrbution (BSD) of UNIX [2].

This widely-adopted open source implementation of the TCP/IP stack offered the capability for any two peer devices to form a connection and exchange data packets regardless of their local network. Without a doubt, the BSD stack (and other TCP/IP implementations) have driven a tremendous amount of innovation over the last 30 years. However, there remains a significant and widely-recognized gap in Internet architecture: a means for peers to establish trust over these digital connections. This gap has often been referred to as "the Internet's missing identity layer" [3].

The purpose of this Aries Concept RFC is to fill this gap by defining a standard information network architecture that developers can implement to establish trusted relationships over digital communicatons networks.


## Architectural Layering of the Trust over IP Stack

Since the ultimate purpose of an "identity layer" is not actually to identify entities, but to facilitate the trust they need to interact, co-author John Jordan coined the term *Trust over IP* (ToIP) for this stack. Figure 1 is a diagram of its four layers:

![Figure 1: The ToIP Stack](./img/fig-1-toip-full-stack.png)

**Figure 1: The ToIP stack**

Note that it is actually a "dual stack": two parallel stacks encompassing both technology and governance. This reflects the fact that digital trust cannot be achieved by technology alone, but only by humans and technology working together. The unique role of governance in the ToIP stack is explored in detail in the section on Layer Four.

## Layer One: Decentralized Identifier (DID) Networks

The ToIP stack is fundamentally made possible by new advancements in cryptography and distributed systems, including blockchains and distributed ledgers. Their high availability and cryptographic verifiability enable strong roots of trust that are decentralized so they will not serve as single points of failure.

### DIDs

Adapting these decentralized systems to be the base layer of the ToIP stack required a new type of globally unique identifier called a Decentralized Identifier (DID). Starting with a research grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology division, the DID specification [4] and the DID Primer [5] were contributed to the W3C Credentials Community Group in June 2017. In September 2019 the W3C launched the DID Working Group to complete the job of turning DIDs into a full W3C standard [6].

DIDs are defined by an [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)-compliant URI scheme designed to provide four core properties:

1. **Permanence**. A DID effectively functions as a Uniform Resource Name (URN) [7], i.e., once assigned to an entity (called the DID subject), a DID is a persistent identifier for that entity that should never be reassigned to another entity.
2. **Resolvability**. A DID resolves to a *DID document*—a data structure (encoded in JSON or other syntaxes) describing the public key(s) and service endpoint(s) necessary to engage in trusted interactions with the DID subject.
3. **Cryptographic verifiability**. The cryptographic material in a DID document that enables a DID subject to prove cryptographic control of a DID.
4. **Decentralization**. Because a DID is cryptographically generated and verified, it does not require centralized registration authority like those needed for phone numbers, IP addresses, or domain names today.

Figure 2 shows the resemblance between DID syntax and URN syntax (RFC 8141).

![Figure 2: The syntax of DIDs follows the same basic pattern as URNs](./img/fig-2-urn-and-did-syntax.png)

**Figure 2: How DID syntax resembles URN syntax**

### DID Methods

Like the URN specification, the DID specification also defines a generic URI scheme which is in turn used for defining other specific URI schemes. With DIDs, these are called *DID methods*. Each DID method is defined by its own DID method specification that must include:

1. The target system (called a *DID registry*) against which the DID method operates. Note that this is not limited to a blockchain or distributed ledger. DID methods can be designed to work with any type of distributed database, file system, or other system that can anchor a cryptographic root of trust.
2. The DID method name.
3. The syntax of the DID method-specific string.
4. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for DIDs and DID documents that conform to the specification.

DIDs have already proved to be a popular solution to decentralized PKI (public key infrastructure) [8]. Over 33 DID methods have already been registered in the informal DID Method Registry [9] hosted by the W3C Credentials Community Group. They include methods for:

* Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin (three methods), Ethereum (six methods), Veres One, IOTA, RChain, Ontology, etc.
* Permissioned ledgers such as the [Sovrin ledger](https://sovrin.org/).
* Distributed file systems such as IPFS.
* Ledgerless P2P networks such as git, JLINC, and peer DIDs.

### Layer One Support for Higher Layers

DIDs and DID documents are not the only cryptographic data structures that Layer One provides to support the higher layers. The others include:

* **Schemas** define the claims (attributes) that can be included in verifiable credentials (Layer Three).
* **Credential definitions** specify the claims and related metadata needed by an issuer of verifiable credentials (Layer Three).
* **Revocation Registries** are [cryptographic accumulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)) that enable credential issuers to revoke credentials while still protecting the privacy of the credential holder (Layer Three).
* **Agent Authorization Policies** are also cryptographic accumulators that enable credential holders to activate and deactivate agents operating on their behalf at Layer Two. (For more information, see section 5.1 of [DKMS Design and Architecture](http://bit.ly/dkms-v4).)

In summary, the interoperability of Layer One is defined by the W3C DID specification and Aries RFCs for the other cryptographic data structures listed above. Any DID registry that supports all of these data structures can work with any agent, wallet, and hub that operates at Layer Two.

## Layer Two: DIDComm

The second layer of the Trust over IP stack is defined by the DIDComm secure messaging standards [10]. This family of specifications, which are now being defined in the DIDComm Working Group at the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) , establish a cryptographic means by which any two software agents (peers) can securely communicate either directly edge-to-edge or via intermediate cloud agents as shown in Figure 3).

![Figure 3: At Layer Two, agents communicate peer-to-peer using DIDComm standards](./img/fig-3-agent-ecosystem.png)

**Figure 3: At Layer Two, agents communicate peer-to-peer using DIDComm standards**

### Peer DIDs and DID-to-DID Connections

A fundamental feature of DIDComm is that by default all DID-to-DID connections are established and secured using pairwise pseudonymous *peer DIDs* as defined in the [Peer DID Method Specification](https://openssi.github.io/peer-did-method-spec/) [11]. These DIDs are based on key pairs generated and stored by the local cryptographic key management system (KMS, aka "wallet") maintained by each agent. Agents then use the DID Exchange protocol to exchange peer DIDs and DID documents in order to establish and maintain secure private *connections* between each other—including key rotation or revocation as needed during the lifetime of a trusted relationship.

Because all of the components of peer DIDs and DID-to-DID connections are created, stored, and managed at Layer Two, there is no need for them to be registered in a Layer One public DID registry. In fact there are good privacy and security reasons not to—these components can stay entirely private to the peers. As a general rule, the only ToIP actors who should need public DIDs at Layer One are credential issuers as explained in Layer Three below.

This also means that, once formed, DID-to-DID connections can be used for any type of secure communications between the peers. Furthermore, these connections are capable of lasting literally *forever*. There are no intermediary service providers of any kind involved. The only reason a DID-to-DID connection needs to end is that one or both of the peers no longer wants it.

### Agents and Wallets

At Layer Two, every agent is paired with a *digital wallet*—or more accurately a KMS (key management system). This KMS can be anything from a very simple static file on an embedded device to a highly sophisticated enterprise-grade key server. Regardless of the complexity, the job of the KMS is to safeguards sensitive data: key pairs, zero-knowledge proof blinded secrets, verifiable credentials, and the other cryptographic material needed to establish and maintain technical trust.

This job includes the difficult challenge of recovery after a device is lost or stolen or a KMS is hacked or corrupted. This is the province of decentralized key management. For more details, see the [Decentralized Key Management System (DKMS) Design and Architecture document](http://bit.ly/dkms-v4) [12], and Dr. Sam Smith's paper on [KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143) [13].

### Hubs

Agents may also be paired with a digital *hub* (also called an *encrypted data vault*)—a data store with three special properties:

1. It is controlled exclusively by the DID controller (person, organization, or thing) and not by any intermediary or third party.
2. All the data is encrypted with private keys in the subject’s KMS.
3. If a DID controller has more than one hub, the set of hubs can be automatically synchronized according to the owner’s preferences.

Work on standardizing digital hubs is proceeding in different projects besides Aries, including at the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](http://identity.foundation/), the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/), and the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) .

### Layer Two Support for Higher Layers

The purpose of Layer Two is to enable peers to form secure DID-to-DID connections so they can:

1. Issue, exchange, and verify credentials over these connections at Layer Three.
2. Access the Layer One cryptographic data structures needed to issue and verify these credentials regardless of the DID registry used by the issuer.
3. Migrate and port ToIP data between agents, wallets, and hubs without restriction. This data portability is critical to the broad adoption and interoperability of ToIP.

## Layer Three: Verifiable Credential Exchange

Layer One and Layer Two together enable the establishment of *cryptographic trust* (also called *technical trust*) between peers. By contrast, the purpose of Layers Three and Four is to establish *human trust* between peers—trust between real-world individuals and organizations and the things with which they interact (devices, sensors, appliances, vehicles, buildings, cities, etc.)

### The Verifiable Credentials Data Model

Layer Three is currently the most advanced in terms of open standards. After several years of incubation led by Manu Sporny, David Longley, and other members of the W3C Credentials Community Group, the W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group (VCWG) was formed in 2017 and produced the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) which became a W3C Recommendation in September 2019 [14].

Figure 4 is a diagram of the three core roles in verifiable credential exchange—often called the "trust triangle". For more information see the [Verifiable Credentials Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-primer.md) [15].

![Figure 4: The three main roles in the W3C Verifiable Credentials ecosystem](./img/fig-4-vc-trust-triangle.png)

**Figure 4: The three main roles in the W3C Verifiable Credentials ecosystem**

### Credential Proof Types

The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 supports several different cryptographic proof types:

1. [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) (JWTs) secured using [JSON Web Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515).
2. [Linked Data Signatures](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/) using JSON-LD.
3. Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) using [Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Signatures](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf).

All three proof types address specific needs in the market:

- JWTs are widely used in the JOSE stack and federated identity infrastructure.
- Linked Data Signatures are used in wide-area data integration and other Semantic Web applications.
- ZKP-based credentials enable credential holders to selectively disclose claims to verifiers without unintentional correlation—a significant advancement in Privacy by Design architecture that simplifies compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and similar data protection regulations.

To support all three of these credential proof types in the ToIP stack means:

* Layer One must support the data structures necessary to issue and verify each proof type.
* Layer Two agents, wallets, and hubs must support storage and export of the cryptographic materials needed for each proof type.
* Layer Three must support credential exchange protocols for each proof type.

### Credential Exchange Protocols

At Layer Three, the exchange of verifiable credentials is performed by agents using extensions of the DIDComm protocol. Extension protocol specifications are being published as part of the DIDComm suite [10]. Extension protocols are unique to each credential proof type because the request and response formats are different. The goal of the ToIP stack is to standardize all supported credential exchange protocols so that any ToIP-compatible agent, wallet, and hub can work with any other agent, wallet, and hub.

With fully interoperable verifiable credentials, any issuer may issue any set of claims to any holder who can then prove them to any verifier. This is a fully decentralized system that uses the same trust triangle as the physical credentials we carry in our physical wallets today. This simple, universal trust model can be adapted to any set of requirements from any trust community. Even better, in most cases it does not require new “trust infrastructure”, rather it simply enables existing physical credentials to be transformed into a more flexible and useful digital format.

### Layer Three Support for Higher Layers

Layer Three enables human trust—in the form of verifiable assertions about entities, attributes and relationships—to be layered over the cryptographic trust provided by Layers One and Two. Layer Four adds interoperable governance models to Layer Three. While governance itself is a quintessentially human process, it is still supported by specific technical features of Layer Three:

* **Specific types of verifiable credentials** implement the roles and responsibilities defined in governance frameworks.
* **Specific types of verifiable credential claims** enable them to be linked to governance frameworks.

These special types of verifiable credentials and claims will typically be defined by *metasystem governance frameworks* (see below).

## Layer Four: Governance Frameworks

The top half of Figure 5 below shows the basic trust triangle architecture used by verifiable credentials. The bottom half shows a second trust triangle—the *governance trust triangle*—that can solve a number of problems related to the real-world adoption and scalability of verifiable credentials.

![Figure 5: The role of governance frameworks](./img/fig-5-gov-frameworks.png)

**Figure 5: The role of governance frameworks**

### Governance Authorities

What the governance trust triangle represents is the same governance model that exists for many of the most successful physical credentials we use every day: passports, driving licenses, credit cards, health insurance cards, etc.

These credentials are "backed" by rules and policies that in many cases have taken decades to evolve. These rules and policies have been developed, published, and enforced by many different types of governance authorities—private companies, industry consortia, financial networks, and of course governments.

The same model can be applied to verifiable credentials simply by having these same governance authorities—or new ones formed explicitly to govern verifiable credentials—publish *digital* governance frameworks.

### Scaling Digital Trust

Any group of issuers who want to standardize, strengthen, and scale the credentials they offer can join together under the auspices of a sponsoring authority to craft a governance framework. No matter the form of the organization—government, consortia, association, cooperative—the purpose is the same: define the business, legal, and technical rules under which the members agree to operate in order to achieve trust.

This of course is exactly how Visa and Mastercard—two of the world’s largest trust networks—have scaled. Any bank or merchant can verify in seconds that another bank or merchant is a member of the network and thus bound by its rules.

With the ToIP stack, this governance architecture can be applied to any set of roles and/or credentials, for any trust community, of any size.

### Layers in the Governance Stack

The ToIP stack does not define specific governance frameworks, rather it is a *metamodel* for how to design and implement digital governance frameworks that can be universally understood, referenced, and navigated online. This approach makes it easier for humans—and the software agents that represent us at Layer Two—to make trust decisions  within and across trust boundaries.

Because governance applies at every level of the ToIP stack, the **ToIP Governance Stack** is actually a parallel stack covering all four levels, with each level serving a specific purpose:

1. **Network Governance Frameworks** specify the rules for operation of a DID registry, no matter what its form or governance model (e.g., public or private, permissioned or permissionless). Note that even permissionless networks still have rules—formal or informal—governing who can update the code.
2. **Provider Governance Frameworks** specify the rules for how providers of ToIP hardware, software, and agencies (hosting providers for cloud agents, wallets, and hubs) can be verified and certified.
3. **Credential Governance Frameworks** specify the issuers whom verifiers can consider authoritative for issuing specific credentials—as well as the policies those issuers must follow to issue and revoke those credentials. Credential governance frameworks can also specify business models, liability frameworks, and insurance models.
4. **Metasystem Governance Frameworks** are designed to serve as umbrellas covering entire trust ecosystems. They specify policies that apply to all the governance authorities and governance frameworks operating within that ecosystem—at all four levels of the ToIP stack.

### Roles in the Governance Stack

Table 1 summarizes twelve roles currently being defined in the ToIP governance stack. Each role represents a specific responsibility at a specific layer. The same legal entity may of course play more than one role—at the same layer, or at multiple layers.

|    Layer Four Roles     |                        Description                        |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Governance Authority   |   Publishes and administers a governance framework (GF)   |
|         Auditor         |       Audits participants for compliance with a GF        |
|   Auditor Accreditor    |                Accredits auditors for a GF                |
|  **Layer Three Roles**  |                                                           |
|      Authoritative Issuer       |      Authoritative issuer of a credential under a GF      |
|   Credential Registry   | Authoritative alternate holder (directory) of credentials |
|         Insurer         |     Insures issuers operating under the terms of a GF     |
|   **Layer Two Roles**   |                                                           |
|   Hardware Developer    |             Provides ToIP-compliant hardware              |
|   Software Developer    |       Provides ToIP-compliant agents, wallets, hubs       |
|         Agency          |             Hosts ToIP-compliant cloud agents             |
|   **Layer One Roles**   |                                                           |
| Transaction Author (TA) |         Initiates a transaction on a DID network          |
|  Transaction Endorser (TE)   | Facilitates TA transactions on a permissioned DID network |
|         Steward         |       Operates a node of a permissioned DID network       |

**Table 1: Standard roles in the ToIP governance stack**

As an historical note, the ToIP governance stack has been inspired by the [Sovrin Governance Framework (SGF)](https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/) [16] developed over the past three years by the [Sovrin Foundation](https://www.sovrin.org), the governance authority for the Sovrin public ledger for self-sovereign identity (SSI). The current second-generation SGF represents a combination of:

1. A Layer One network governance framework for Transaction Authors, Transaction Endorsers, and Stewards of the Sovrin ledger, and
1. A Layer Four metasystem governance framework for the Sovrin ecosystem.

The Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group [17] is currently developing a third generation of the SGF that will fully adapt it to the ToIP governance stack.

### Defining a Governance Framework

In addition to the overall metamodel, the ToIP governance stack will provide an architectural model for individual governance frameworks at any level. This enables the components of the governance framework to be expressed in a standard, modular format so they can be easily indexed and referenced both internally and externally from other governance frameworks.

Figure 6 shows this basic architectural model:

![Figure 6: Anatomy of a governance framework](./img/fig-6-governance-framework-model.png)

**Figure 6: Anatomy of a governance framework**

### Discovery and Verification of Authoritative Issuers

Verifiers often need to verify that a credential was issued by an authoritative issuer. The ToIP stack gives governance authorities several mechanisms for designating its set of authoritative issuers:

1. **DID Documents.** If the set of authortiative issuers is relatively small, the governance authority can publish the list of authortiative issuer DIDs in a DID document on one or more DID registries of its choice.
2. **Verifiable credentials.** As shown in Figure 5, the governance authority (or its designated auditors) can issue verifiable credentials to the authoritative issuers, which they in turn can provide directly to verifiers or indirectly via credential holders.
3. **Credential registries.** For search and discovery, a governance authority can also publish verifiable credentials for each authoritative issuer to a credential registry. Note that in this case the credential registry serves as a *separate, cryptographically-verifiable holder of the credential*—a holder that is not the subject of the credential, but which can independently prove the validity of the credential.

### Interoperability with Other Governance Frameworks

The ToIP governance stack is designed to be compatible with—and an implementation vehicle for—national governance frameworks such as the [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)](https://diacc.ca/pan-canadian-trust-framework/) [18] being developed through a public/private sector collaboration with the [Digital Identity and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)](https://diacc.ca/). It should also interoperate with regional and local governance frameworks of all kinds. For example, the Province of British Columbia (BC) has implemented a ToIP-compatible verifiable credential registry service called [OrgBook BC](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca). OrgBook is a holder/prover service for legally registered entities in BC and is built using [Indy Catalyst](https://www.github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst) and [Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent - Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python). Other provinces such as Ontario and Alberta as well as the Canadian federal government have begun to experiment with these services for business credentials, giving rise to new kind of network where trust is at the edge. For more information see the [VON (Verifiable Organization Network)](https://vonx.io/) [19].

## Building a World of Interoperable Trust Networks

The Internet is a network of networks, where the interconnections between each network are facilitated through the TCP/IP stack. The ToIP-enable Internet is a *trust network of trust networks*, where the interconnections between each trust network are facilitated through the ToIP stack. In this picture, the boundaries of each trust network are determined by the governance framework(s) under which its members are operating.

This allows the ToIP-enabled Internet to reflect the same diversity and richness it has today, but with a new ability to form and maintain trust relationships of any kind—personal, business, social, academic, political—at any distance. These trust relationships can cross trust boundaries as easily as IP packets can cross network boundaries today.

Figure 7 is a simplified conceptual diagram of this ecosystem of overlapping trust networks operating at all four levels of the ToIP stack. Peers exist at every level, and the visible, reference-able governance frameworks enable participants in any of them have a common basis for making trust decisions about participants in the others.

![Figure 7: Example of a ToIP ecosystem of trust networks](./img/fig-7-toip-ecosystems.png)

Note the special role of metasystem governance frameworks. They form the largest overarching umbrellas of trust by establishing the common purpose, principles, and policies by which all governance authorities and governance frameworks in that metasystem will abide. As Figure 7 shows, some network, provider, or credential governance frameworks may be designed to be interoperable across multiple metasystem governance frameworks, providing even more bridges of trust.

## Conclusion: A Trust Layer for the Internet

The purpose of the ToIP stack is to define a strong, decentralized, privacy-respecting trust layer for the Internet. It leverages blockchain technology and other new developments in cryptography, decentralized systems, cloud computing, mobile computing, and digital governance to solve longstanding problems in establishing and maintaining digital trust.

This RFC will be updated to track the evolution of the ToIP stack as it is further developed through a series of Aries RFCs. We welcome comments and contributions.
